# WebGL GPU Score

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/bentleycs/iModelTechnologies/_apis/build/status/imodeljs.webgl-gpu-score?branchName=release%2F1.0)](https://dev.azure.com/bentleycs/iModelTechnologies/_build/latest?definitionId=4625&branchName=release%2F1.0)

An API for running tests to give a score to the GPU a browser is running with.

See [test.html](test.html) for an example use.

***Warning***:

When developing, the fill rate testing canvas is expanded for inspection, and it can flash colors very quickly, I'm no doctor but I would suggest
avoiding it as a seizure risk if epileptic.
